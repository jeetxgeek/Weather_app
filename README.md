# 🌤️ Weather Web App – Project Description (HTML, CSS, JS)
##Description
```
Created a responsive weather web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Integrated with OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live weather data based on user-input city.

Displays key weather information like temperature, city name, humidity, and wind speed.

Implements a gradient background that changes dynamically based on the current temperature (cold, moderate, or hot).

Includes form validation and a warning message if the user enters a country instead of a city.

Used JavaScript DOM manipulation for updating the UI dynamically after API fetch.

Custom weather icons are displayed based on real-time conditions (e.g., rain, clear, snow).
